What is IOC or inversion of control?
	As the name implies Inversion of the control means now we jave inverted the control of creating the object the object from our own using new operator to container or framework.
	Now its the responsibility of the container to create an object as required.
Explain the Spring Bean-LifeCycle.
	If the bean implements the BeanNameAware interface, the factory calls setBeanName() passing the bean’s ID.
	If the bean implements the BeanFactoryAware interface, the factory calls setBeanFactory(), passing an instance of itself.
	If there are BeanPostProcessors associated with the bean, their post- ProcessBeforeInitialization() methods will be called before the properties for the Bean are set.
	If an init() method is specified for the bean it will be called.
	If the Bean class impelements the DisposableBean interface then destroy() method will be called when the Applcation no loger needs the bean reference.
What is Bean Factory, have you used XMLBeanFactory?
	BeanFactory is factory Pattern which is based on IOC desing principles it is used to make a clear separation between application configuration and dependency from actual code.
	The org.springframework.beans.factory.xml.XmlBeanFactory is used to create bean instance defined in our XML file.
	BeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(new FileInputStream("beans.xml")); OR
	ClassPathResource resource = new ClassPathResource("beans.xml");
	XmlBeanFactory factory = new XmlBeanFactory(resource);
What id APO?
	The core construct of AOP is the aspect, which encapsulates behaviors affecting multiple classes into reusable modules. AOP is a programming technique that allows a developer to modularize crosscutting concerns, that cuts across the typical divisions of responsibility, such as logging and transaction management.

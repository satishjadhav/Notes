--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Java Serialization is the process which is used to serialize object in java by storing object's state into a file with extension .ser and recreating object's state from that file,this reverse process is called deserialization.
-Object Serialization in Java is a process used to convert Object into a binary format which can be persisted into disk or sent over network to any other running Java virtual machine, the reverse process of creating object from binary stream is called deserialization in Java.
-Java provides Serialization API for serializing and deserializing object which includes java.io.Serializable, java.io.Externalizable, ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream etc. Java programmers are free to use default Serialization mechanism which Java uses based upon structure of class but they are also free to use there own custom binary format, which is often advised as Serialization best practice, Because serialized binary format becomes part of Class's exported API and it can potentially break Encapsulation in Java provided by private and package-private fields.
-One example of How Serialization can put constraints on your ability to change class is SerialVersionUID. If you don't explicitly declare SerialVersionUID then JVM generates its based upon structure of class which depends upon interfaces a class implements and several other factors which is subject to change. 
-1) What is the difference between Serializable and Externalizable interface in Java?
	Externalizable provides us writeExternal() and readExternal() method which gives us flexibility to control java serialization mechanism instead of relying on Java's default serialization.
-2) How many methods Serializable has? If no method then what is the purpose of Serializable interface?
	Serializable interface exists in java.io package and forms core of java serialization mechanism. It doesn't have any method and also called Marker Interface in Java. When your class implements java.io.Serializable interface it becomes Serializable in Java and gives compiler an indication that use Java Serialization mechanism to serialize this object.
-3) What is serialVersionUID? What would happen if you don't define this?
	One of my favorite question interview question on Java serialization. SerialVersionUID is an ID which is stamped on object when it get serialized usually hashcode of object, you can use tool serialver to see serialVersionUID of a serialized object . SerialVersionUID is used for version control of object. you can specify serialVersionUID in your class file also. Consequence of not specifying serialVersionUID is that when you add or modify any field in class then already serialized class will not be able to recover because serialVersionUID generated for new class and for old serialized object will be different. Java serialization process relies on correct serialVersionUID for recovering state of serialized object and throws java.io.InvalidClassException in case of serialVersionUID mismatch.
	When you declare a class as Serializable by implementing marker interface java.io.Serializable, Java runtime persist instance of that class into disk using default Serialization mechanism,provided you have not customized the process using Externalizable interface.
-4) While serializing you want some of the members not to serialize? How do you achieve it?
	Transient keyword is used in serialization process to prevent any variable from being serialized,so if you have any field which is not making sense to serialize,you can simply declare that as transient and it won't be serialized.
	During Serialization all property of objects gets saved except static and transient.
	Transient keyword can only be applied to fields or member variable. Applying it to method or local variable is compilation error.
	Another important point is that you can declare an variable static and transient at same time and java compiler doesn't complain but doing that doesn't make any sense because transient is to instruct "do not save this field" and static variables are not saved anyway during serialization.
	In similar way you can apply transient and final keyword together to a variable compiler will not complain but you will face another problem of reinitializing a final variable during deserialization.
	Transient keyword also saves you with NotSerializable exception. If you have a field in your Class which does not implement Serializable interface than there is no way out other than marking it transient.
-5) What will happen if one of the members in the class doesn't implement Serializable interface?
	If you try to serialize an object of a class which implements Serializable, but the object includes a reference to an non- Serializable class then a ‘NotSerializableException’ will be thrown at runtime and this is why I always put a SerializableAlert
-6) If a class is Serializable but its super class in not, what will be the state of the instance variables inherited from super class after deserialization?
	Java serialization process only continues in object hierarchy till the class is Serializable i.e. implements Serializable interface in Java and values of the instance variables inherited from super class will be initialized by calling constructor of Non-Serializable Super class during deserialization process.
	Once the constructor chaining will started it wouldn't be possible to stop that , hence even if classes higher in hierarchy implements Serializable interface , there constructor will be executed.
-7) Can you Customize Serialization process or can you override default Serialization process in Java?
	The answer is yes you can. We all know that for serializing an object ObjectOutputStream.writeObject (saveThisobject) is invoked and for reading object ObjectInputStream.readObject() is invoked but there is one more thing which Java Virtual Machine provides you is to define these two method in your class.
	If you define these two methods in your class then JVM will invoke these two methods instead of applying default serialization mechanism.
-8) Suppose super class of a new class implement Serializable interface, how can you avoid new class to being serialized?
	If Super class of a Class already implements Serilizable interface in Java then its already Serializable in Java,since you can not unimplemented an interface its not really possible to make it Non Serializable class but yes ther is a way to avoid serialization of new class.To avoid Java serialization you need to implement writeObject() and readObject() method in your Class and need to throw 'NotSerializableException' from those method.
-9) Which methods are used during Serialization and DeSerialization process in Java?
	 Java Serialization is done by java.io.ObjectOutputStream class. That class is a filter stream which is wrapped around a lower-level byte stream to handle the serialization mechanism. To store any object via serialization mechanism we call ObjectOutputStream.writeObject(saveThisobject) and to deserialize that object we call ObjectInputStream.readObject() method. Call to writeObject() method trigger serialization process in java. one important thing to note about readObject() method is that it is used to read bytes from the persistence and to create object from those bytes and its return an Object which needs to be type cast to correct type.
-10) Suppose you have a class which you serialized it and stored in persistence and later modified that class to add a new field. What will happen if you deserialize the object already serialized?
	It depends on whether class has its own serialVersionUID or not. As we know from above question that if we don't provide serialVersionUID in our code java compiler will generate it and normally it’s equal to hashCode of object. by adding any new field there is chance that new serialVersionUID generated for that class version is not the same of already serialized object and in this case Java Serialization API will throw java.io.InvalidClassException and this is the reason its recommended to have your own serialVersionUID in code and make sure to keep it same always for a single class.
-13) Which kind of variables is not serialized during Java Serialization?
	Since static variables belong to the class and not to an object they are not the part of the state of object so they are not saved during Java Serialization process. As Java Serialization only persist state of object and not object itself. Transient variables are also not included in java serialization process and are not the part of the object’s serialized state.

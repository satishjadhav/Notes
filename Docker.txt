Docker
Managing Ports:
	In docker the containers themselves can have applications running on ports.When you run a container if you want to access the application in the container via a port number, you need to map the port number of the application in the container via a port number,you need to map the port number of container to the port number of the Docker host.
	-sudo docker pull jenkins
	To understand what ports are exposed by the container, you should use the Docker inspect command to inspect the image.
	Docker inspect: This method allows to return low-level inforamtion on the container or image.
	Syntax:	docker inspect Contianer/Image
	e.g:	sudo docker inspect jenkins
	
	-sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins
	The left-hand side of the port number mapping is the Docker host port to map to and the right-hand side is the Docker container port number.
Docker - Private Registries
	You might have the need to have your own private repositories.You may not want to host the repositories on Docker Hub.For this there is a repository contianer itself from Docker.
	Docker run command to download the private registry.
	sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
	Registry is the container managed by Docker which can be used to host private repositories.

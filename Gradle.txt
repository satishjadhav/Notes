What is gradle build system:
	Gradle is an advanced general purpose build management system based on Groovy and Kotline.
	Gradle supports automatic download and configuration of dependancies or other libraries.
	It supports Maven and Ivy repositories for retrieving these dependencies.
	Gradle has the notation of projects and tasks.
Projects and gradle tasks in Gradle:
	Each project consists of tasks.A task represent a piece of work a build performs,e.g. compile the source code or generate the Javadoc.
The Gradle build file- build.gradle
	This file is located in the root folder of the project.
	The build file for Gradle builds is based on a Domain Specific Language (DSL).
	This build file defines a project and its tasks.
	
	e.g. task hello {
		doLast {
			println 'Hello Gradle'
		}
	}

	or task hello << {
		println 'Hello Gradle'
	}

	exection: gradle hello	gradle -q hello
	-You can user single and multiline comments in Gradle build files.
	By default gradle uses the directory name as project name.You can change this by creating a settings.gradle file in the directory which specifies the project name.
	rootProject.name='com.vogella.gradle.first'
	You can add a description to your project via the build.gradle file.
Gradle plug-ins
	A plug-in is an extension to Gradle which typically addds some preconfigured tasks.
	A plugin is included in a build.gradle file with the apply plugin: 'pluginname' statement.
	Gradle provides also a registry for plug-ins via Gradle Plugin search.
Installing and configuring Gradle
	Download gradle-${version}-all.zip where ${version} is a placeholder for the current version.
	SDKMAN is a command-line tool that allows you to install multiple Gradle versions and switch between them.
	curl -s "https:.//get.sdkman.io" | bash
	Installing Gradle and settings defult version
		sdk install gradle 3.2
		sdk default gradle 3.2
		gradle -v
	Switching Gradle version
		sdk install gradle 2.13
		# use 2.13 for current terminal session
		sdk use gradle 2.13
		gradle -v
Using the Gradle daemon for improved startup time
	Gradle allows to start Gradle as daemon to avoid starting the JVM machime for every build.Tc configure that create a file called gradle.properties in the ${HOME}/.gradle and add the following line to it:
		org.gradle.daemon=true
Check if Gradle installation was successful (Resumed)

Difference between final,finally,finalize
final:
	1.final is a modifier applicable for class,methods and variables.If a class declared as	final then we can't extend that class.i.e we can't create child class for that class.
	2.If a method declared as final then we can't override that method in the child class.
	3.IF a variable declred as final then it will become constant and we can't perform re-assignment for that variable.
finally:
	finally is a block always associated with try catch to maintain cleanup code.
finalize:
	finalize() is a method which is always invoked by garbage collector just before destroying an object to perform cleanup activities.
finally meant for cleanup activities related to try block.where as finalize() meant for cleanup activities related to object.

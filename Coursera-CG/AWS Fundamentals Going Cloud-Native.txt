-Welcome to AWS Fundamentals: Going Cloud-Native
-Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
-AWS Overview
	Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computer power,database storage,applications and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
	Six Advantages and Benefits of Cloud Computing
		Trade capital expenses for variable expenses
		Benefits from massive economics of scale
		Stop guessing capacity
		Increase speed and agility
		Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centres.
		Go global minutes.
	What is cloud computing by AWS?
		Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.Instead of buying,owning and maintaining physical data centres and servers,you can access technology services such as computing power,storage and databases on as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).
	Product and services
		AWS offers a broad set of global cloud-based products, including compute,storage,databases,analytics,networking,mobile,developer tools,management tools,Internet of Things(IoT),security,and enterprise applications.
-AWS Infrastructure Part 1
	The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability Zones.AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones are connected with low latency,high throughput, and highly redundant networking.	
-What is our Sample App?
-Introduction to compute Services on AWS
	Building and running your application start with compute,whether you are building enterprise,cloud-native or mobile applications;or running cluster to sequence the human genome.
	Building and running your application starts with compute, whether you are building enterprise, cloud-native, or mobile applications; or running massive clusters to sequence the human genome.

	AWS offers a comprehensive portfolio of compute services that allow you to develop, deploy, run, and scale your applications and workloads in the world’s most powerful, secure, and innovative compute cloud.

	Details about the full range of AWS compute services can be found here .

	Later in this module, you will learn about both Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Lightsail. See those sections for more details.

	Both serverless computing and container services are beyond the scope of this class. We will cover these topics in subsequent courses, but the following descriptions provide an introduction to some of the key services for serverless computing and containers.
	AWS Lambda

	AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume--there is no charge when your code isn't running. Additional information about Lambda can be found at: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda
	AWS Container Services

	Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers. It allows you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. You can find more details at: https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/

	Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) makes it straightforward to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications that use Kubernetes on AWS. Details can be found at: https://aws.amazon.com/eks/

	AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or clusters. You can find more information at: https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/

	Note that before you use any of these services, you should check whether they are eligible for the AWS Free Tier: https://aws.amazon.com/free
-Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud or what we will call EC2 from here on out is a compute service that allows you to provision virtual servers on demand.
	Each virtual server you provision is called an EC2 instance.
	Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides secure and resizeable compute capacity in the cloud.Its designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
	Amazon EC2 presents a true virtual computing environment and it allows you ti use web service interfaces to launch instances with a verity of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment manage your networks access permissions and run your image by using as many or few systems as you want.
-Introduction to Amazon Lightsail (Amazon computing server)
	Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with AWS for developers small business,students and other users who need a simple virtual private server (VPS) solution.
	Lightsail provides developers compute, storage, and networking capacity, and it also provides capabilities to deploy and manage websites and web applications in the cloud.
-week 2 Introduction to Module 2 Networking and Storage
	Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS cloud.Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated inside an Availability Zone to protect you form component failure which offers high availability and durability.
	Amazon EBS volumes offer the consistent and low-latency performance that you need to run your workloads.
	Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) stores data as objects within resources that are called buckets.
	CIDR Notation
	An important concepts that's used in networking on AWS is CIDR or Classless Inter-Domain Routing.CIDR network addresses are allocated in a virtual private cloud (VPC) and in subnet by using CIDR notation.
	A /16 block provides 65,536 IPv4 addresses. A /24 block provides 256 addresses. See this article for more information about CIDR.
	Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
		Amazon Virtual Private Cloud lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
-Introduction to Storage on AWS
-Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
	Amazon Elastic Block Store provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instance in the AWS Cloud.Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated inside an availability zone to protect you from component failure, which offer high availability and durability.
	EBS volumes offer the consistent and low-latency performance that you need to run your workloads.
-Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
	Stores data as objects within resources that are called buckets.You can store as many objects as you want within a bucket and you can write, read and delete objects in your bucket.Objects can be up to 5 TB in size.
-Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
	It provides simple scalable elastic file storage for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
	It's designed to provide massively parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances.This enables your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS that scale as a file system grows with consistent low latencies.
-Amazon Relational Data Base Services (RDS)
	Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it straightforward to set up,operate and scale a relational database in the cloud.
	It provides cost-efficient and resizeable capacity while automating time-consuming administration tasks such as provisioning hardware, setting up the database,patching and making backups.
	You can use the AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to quickly and securely migrate your database to AWS.
-Amazon DynamoDB
	Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoQL database service for application that need consistent,simple-digit millisecond latency at any scale.Its fully managed cloud database and it supports both documents and key-value store models.Its flexible data model, reliable performance, and automatic scaling of throughput capacity make it a great fit for mobile,web,gaming, advertising(ad tech),Internet Of Things(Iot), and many other applications.
-Introduction to module 4 : Monitoring and Scaling our application
	Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service built for DevOps engineers,developers,site reliability engineers (SREs) and IT mangers. CloudWatch provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your applications, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health.CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers.
	 You can use CloudWatch to detect anomalous behaviour in your environments, set alarms, visualize logs and metrics side by side, take automated actions, troubleshoot issues, and discover insights to keep your applications running smoothly.
	 Amazon CloudWatch
		Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS Cloud resources and the applications that you run on AWS. You can use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources.

	Amazon CloudWatch Events
		Amazon CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in AWS resources. Using simple rules that you can quickly set up, you can match events and route them to one or more target functions or streams. CloudWatch Events becomes aware of operational changes as they occur.

	Amazon CloudWatch Logs Metrics
		You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon EC2 instances, AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Route 53, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs.
		You can collect metrics from servers by installing the CloudWatch agent on the server. You can install the agent on both Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers, and on servers that run either Linux or Windows Server.
	
	Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones.

	ELB offers three types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security that are necessary to make your applications fault-tolerant.

	An Application Load Balancer operates at the request level (Layer 7), routing traffic to targets--such as EC2 instances, microservices and containers--within Amazon VPC, based on the content of the request. It's ideal for the advanced load balancing of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) traffic.

	A Network Load Balancer operates at the connection level (Layer 4), routing connections to targets--such as Amazon EC2 instances, microservices, and containers--within Amazon VPC, based on IP protocol data. It's ideal for load-balancing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) traffic.

	The Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances, and it operates at both the request level and the connection level.	
-Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability, and it allows you to dynamically 	scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically according to conditions that you define. You can use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling for fleet management of Amazon EC2 instances, which can help maintain the health and availability of your fleet, and ensure that you are running your desired number of Amazon EC2 instances. You can also use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to dynamically scale Amazon EC2 instances. Dynamic scaling automatically increases the number of Amazon EC2 instances during demand spikes to maintain performance and decrease capacity during lulls, which can help reduce costs. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling is well-suited to applications that have stable demand patterns, or applications that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage.
-Module 5 Security in AWS 
Amazon Shared Responsibility Model
	Security and compliance are shared responsibilities between us and the customer. This shared model can help relieve a customer’s operational burden because we operate, manage, and control the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities where the service operates. The customer is responsible for--and manages--the guest operating system (including updates and security patches) and other associated application software, in addition to the configuration of the AWS-provided security group firewall. Customers should carefully consider the services that they choose because their responsibilities will vary depending on the services that they use, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations. The nature of this shared responsibility also provides the flexibility and customer control that permits the deployment. This differentiation of responsibility is commonly referred to as Security of the Cloud versus Security in the Cloud.

AWS responsibility
	Security of the Cloud: We are responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services that are offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.

Customer responsibility
	Security in the Cloud: Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities.

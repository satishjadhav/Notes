-SQL is a powerful declarative language that you can grasp by understanding a few basic concepts.
-Understanding Basic SQL syntax
-BETWEEN
	Acts on column and two values
	TRUE if column value is between two values
	Inclusive - includes two values (like >= & <=)
-The WHERE clause enables us to restrict the result set of our queries
-The more complex the question we want to ask, the more complex the WHERE clause becomes.
-Shaping Results with ORDER BY and GROUP BY
-GROUP BY
	Allows multiple columns with a set function
	Breaks result set into subsets
	Runs set function against each subset
	Result set returns 1 row per sunset
	Subset is dictated by column in GROUP BY
	Column must appear in the SELECT LIST
	Appears after FROM and/or WHERE clauses
-OUTER JOIN
	INNSER JOIN doesn't deal with NULL values
	OUTER JOIN works even when no match
	NULL columns if no match in second table
	FULL OUTER JOIN returns all joined rows
	NULL when no match in either table

-Docker and Containers The Big Picture
-Docker Deep Dive
-Integrating Docker with DevOps Automated Workflows
-Docker Swarm: Native Docker Clustering
-Working with Containers
-docker run
	to run a new container
-docker ps
	to see running and stopped containers
-docker images
	to see info about images
-docker rmi
	Removes images from DOcker Host
-docker rm
	Removes (deletes) stopped containers
-Installing Docker gives you the client and daemon
	Client makes API calls to daemon
	Daemon implements the Docker Remote API
	docker run starts a new container
	Docker Hub is the default public registry
	The daemon will pull images that it doesn't already have
->Containers and Images
-docker run -d/ -it <image>
->Swarm Mode and Micro services
-Terminology
	A cluster = A swarm
	Engines in a swarm run in swarm mode
	Manager nodes maintain the swarm
		H/A - recommended 3or 5
		Only one is leader
	Worker nodes executes tasks 
	Services
		Declarative and scalable
	Taks
		Assigned to workers
		Containers
->Configuring Swarm Mode
	docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.31.12.161:2377 --listen-addr 172.31.12.161:2377
-Docker Inc are calling this native container aware load balancer the "routing mesh"
It can augment existing non-container-aware load balacers
-docker service ps psight1
-docker service create \ --update-parallelism 2 \ --update-delay 10m
-Stacks and Bundles
